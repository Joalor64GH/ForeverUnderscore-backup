# [Forever Engine Underscore](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/Forever-Engine-Underscore)
A custom-made Forever Engine build which aims to make things a little easier.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine Underscore attempts to take on the challenge of making Forever Engine a lot easier by adding tools, such as a scripting system and more. 

The Forever Engine Underscore project is currently maintained by a **solo developer** and [GitHub Contributors](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/Forever-Engine-Underscore/pulls), but already contains features that can make anyone's life easier.

----------------------------------------------
# Current Goals:
* Implement Customizable Weeks via JSON Files;
* Implement Polymod to allow for Custom Mods and Modpacks to be created, see [Unstable Branch](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/Forever-Engine-Underscore/tree/unstable);
* Finish the Chart Editor (HIGH PRIORITY);

# Features:
* Custom Notetypes;
* Scripted Stages
* Custom Credits Menu with Customizable Credits via JSON files;
* Psych Engine Character Support;
* Strumline Manipulation (position, angle, etc.);
* Custom Dialogue Text Support;
* (Upcoming) Revamped Chart Editor.
  * Press ``Shift + 7`` during a song (Freeplay only) for a preview

and much more to come in the future!
