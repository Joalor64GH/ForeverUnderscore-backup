# [Forever Engine Underscore](https://github.com/BeastlyGhost/Forever-Engine-Underscore)
A custom-made Forever Engine build which aims to make things a little easier.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine Underscore attempts to take on the challenge of making Forever Engine a lot easier by adding tools, such as a scripting system and more. 

The Forever Engine Underscore project is currently pretty powerful by itself, but contributions for further improving and expanding upon the project are and will always be appreciated.

----------------------------------------------
# Current Goals:
* make Notes and Notetypes Scripted, allowing for no source code interaction while messing with them;
* Finish the Chart Editor **(HIGH PRIORITY)**;

help would be extremely appreciated!

# Features:
* a Full Scripting System, SScript! which uses hscript as a basis;
* Custom Notetypes;
* Scripted Stages;
* Custom Credits Menu with Customizable Credit Entries via JSON files;
* Psych Engine Character Support;
* Strumline Manipulation (position, angle, etc.);
* Custom Dialogue Text Support;
* (Upcoming) Revamped Chart Editor.
  * Press ``Shift + 7`` during a song (Freeplay only) for a preview

and much more to come in the future!
